This is the downstream_ext jenkins plugin. It's official homepage is 
http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Downstream-Ext+Plugin

This plugin supports extended configuration for triggering downstream builds:
* trigger build only if downstream job has SCM changes
* trigger build only if current job has SCM changes
* trigger build if upstream build result is better/equal/worse than any given result (SUCCESS, UNSTABLE, FAILURE, ABORTED)
* Matrix (alias multi-configuration) jobs you can decide which part of the job should trigger the downstream job: parent only, configurations only or both
